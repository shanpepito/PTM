BSIT 4B - DAY

"Reflection"

What I learned while making this activity is how important a personal 
task manager, so it is needed to be accurate in adding, deleting and
accomplishing a task. I also learned that it may be simple as it looks
like but it is meticulous to make. Furthermore, this activity makes me 
think of ideas to add since its called as personal task manager, so I 
want it to be according to my style and kind of taste in having a 
manual task manager.
